# Learning_FSA

An application where you can train a deterministic finite state automaton(FSA) to recognize certain strings.

### How can you train the automaton:
- Give strings as input, specifying whether it should recognize them or not ✔
- Change the settings by which the FSA recognizes unfamiliar strings ❌
- Use additional features to work with the FSA, including: minimizing the automaton(➕), maybe something else

### Killer features:
- *in the future* graphical interface ❌
- possibility to export FSA to a text file, as an image ✔
