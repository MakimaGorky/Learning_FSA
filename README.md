# Learning_FSA

An application where you can train a deterministic finite state automaton(DFA) to recognize certain strings.

### How can you train the automaton:
- Give strings as input, specifying whether it should recognize them or not ✔
- Change the settings by which the FSA recognizes unfamiliar strings ✔
- Use additional features to work with the FSA, including: minimizing the automaton(✔) changing empty word recognition, maybe something else

### Killer features:
- *in the future* graphical interface ✔
- possibility to export FSA as an image ✔
- *in progress export as a file*
